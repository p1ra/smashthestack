<h2>What is Smash the Stack?</h2></a>
<div name="information" >
The Smash the Stack Wargaming Network hosts several Wargames. A Wargame in our
context can be described as an ethical hacking environment that supports the
simulation of real world software vulnerability theories or concepts and allows
for the legal execution of exploitation techniques. Software can be an Operating
System, network protocol, or any userland application.
<br/>
</div>
<br/><br/>
<a name="a2"><h2>How do I connect to the Wargames?</h2></a>
<div name="information" >
To connect to any of the Wargames you need an ssh client (openssh, PuTTy, SecureCRT). Each game has it's own set of connection details. You need
to pay attention to the <b><i>port</i></b> and initial username. If you are using a unix variant simply type the following at
the shell prompt: <br/>
<b><pre>
user@box:$ ssh -l level1 io.smashthestack.org -p2224
</pre></b>
when you are prompted for the password enter "level1" without the quotes. This information is also provided on the `io' wargame page.
Once you are logged in read the text (MOTD: Message of the day) that is displayed on your screen. 
<br/>
</div>
<br/><br/>
<a name="a3"><h2>How do I get the password for the next level?</h2></a>
<div name="information" >
The password for each level is located in different places depending on the game, but it will be located in one of the following locations:
<b><pre>
~/.pass
~/passwd
/pass/
</pre></b>
the MOTD will specify exactly where it is located for each game. To view it simply use /bin/cat
<b><pre>
user@box:$ cat ~/.pass
user@box:$ cat /pass/level1
user@box:$ cat ~/passwd
</pre></b>
<br/>
</div>
<br/><br/>
<a name="a4"><h2>I'm connected now what?</h2></a>
<div name="information" >

<br/><br/>
<a name="a5"><h2>What operating system do I need to play?</h2></a>
<div name="information" >
Any OS will do. Windows, Linux, BeOS, MacOS, BSD, or VMS.
<br/>
</div>
<br/><br/>
<a name="a6"><h2>What is the goal of the games?</h2></a>
<div name="information" >
The goal of the games is for you to get from the first level to the (current) last level. Along the way you should pickup or refine any
techniques that were required to defeat the level. The levels for each game are structured progressively.
You start at the <b><i>first</i></b> level. Once you have completed the first level you will
have the credentials to view the password for the next level. This is the same for all the games. To view your current credentials or
userid type the following at the shell prompt:
<b><pre>
user@box:$ id
</pre></b>
the text that is returned is your current user level status.
